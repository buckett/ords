#summary How to install X509 credentials into the repository.

= Introduction =

X509 credentials are stored in the SVN repository. The private key is encrypted with a key derived from a key know to the visualisation node. The key derivation function used is documented in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869 RFC5869]. The VM's IP address is used as info parameter to derive the keys used to encrypt the certificate's private key.

= Details =

X506 certificates are stored in subversion, currently in: `/ords-vmconfig/trunk/hosts/`*`<FQDN>`*`/root/etc/ssl/certs/host-cert.pem`

The matching key is stored here: `/ords-vmconfig/trunk/hosts/`*`<FQDN>`*`/root/etc/ssl/private/host-key.pem.aes-256-cbc`

Use the following command to decrypt / encrypt the private key:

`openssl aes-256-cbc [-d] -a -in inputfile -out outputfile -K key -iv iv`
